Answers to Lab 4, part I:

2. Nothing happens. No error. We expect to get a message saying there is no file at this 
   index, notan error though.
   
3. No error, the second file inputed is returned. Now that we have removed the first file, 
   the second file now becomes the first file. 
   
4. private ArrayList<Book> library;

5. cs101 = new ArrayList<Student>();

6. private ArrayList<MusicTrack> tracks;

7. library.add(bookname);
   cd101.add(cdname);
   tracks.add(trackname);

8. 11

9. public String getObject() {
    
    return items.get(4);
   }

10. 14.

11. public void addObject() {
     
     String favouriteTrack = "something";
     files.add(favouriteTrack);
    }
    
12. public removeObject() {
    dates.remove(2);
    }
    
13. It will become 5.

14. Yes it still works.
